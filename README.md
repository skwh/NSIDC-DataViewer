## NSIDC DataViewer

These Jupyter / IPython notebooks are used to animate the 0046 and 0051 datasets at NSIDC for use by the OPs team in their QA check.

These require the `/projects/DATASETS` and /disks/sidads_staging` folders to be automounted to the same vm running jupyterhub.

Also required: Python3, Anaconda3.5, and `libav-tools`.
